JetSetFacts Trivia Game

The JetSetFacts trivia game is a JavaScript application that uses variables, arrays, loops, conditionals and timers to create a simple trivia game. 

The concept was designed to quiz people on their knowledge of cultural information about specific countries they choose to learn about and aims to make users more culturally affluent and ready to travel to new places after playing the game. 

To use this application simply go to the following link on GitHub pages and click "Start Game"

This project was developed to practice and demonstrate the use of JavaScript and timers for the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp in 2019.
