JetSetFacts Trivia Game

The JetSetFacts trivia game is a JavaScript application that uses JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. It also utilizes valid HTML and stylish CSS. 

The concept was designed to quiz people on their knowledge of cultural information about specific countries they choose to learn about and aims to make users more culturally affluent and ready to travel to new places after playing the game.
